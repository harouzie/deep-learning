# Course: Introduction to Deep Learning 
__Day 1: Introduction to Deep Learning__

- Distinguish the differences between traditional ML and Deep Learning (capabilities, objective, problem, why, models, ...)

|ML     | DL |
| :---      | :---    |
| need human interaction with data to ensure model fits well        | need less human involment or no need at all
| performance decrease when dataset size increase       | work better in massive dataset 
|   |           |



## How to develope a DL system
- Understanding DL Models
- Implementation
- Tuning pre-trained models
- Runing Environment
- Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Data Labeling

## What should be learnt in Machine Learning?
- Understanding ML models
    - Architecture, Structure, or form of the models
    - Computation, inference/reasoning
- Methods/Algorithms for learning models’ parameters
- Model evaluation
- Data Processing: data collection; feature selection; dimensional reduction, noisy filtering,…
- Other issues: overfitting,
